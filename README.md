# Physics Engine Simulation with Pygame and Pymunk

This project is a simple physics engine simulation that allows users to create and interact with colorful balls in a 2D environment. Built using Pygame for graphics and Pymunk for physics, the simulation showcases realistic ball behavior under gravity and collision.

## Features

- **Interactive Ball Creation:** Click and hold the left mouse button to spawn balls with random sizes and colors.
- **Realistic Physics:** The simulation utilizes Pymunk to simulate gravity and collisions, making the movement of the balls realistic.
- **Dynamic Ball Count Display:** The current number of balls created is shown at the top center of the screen.
